# myportfolio

This site contains two html docs. The first page is an introduction page with my contact information.
When the MY WORK button is clicked the user is
directed to a html page that contains images of my work. When the work image is clicked
you are redirected to the deployed page or github site.
When my name is clicked the user will be redirected to my resume.  This site is responsive to mobile users.
