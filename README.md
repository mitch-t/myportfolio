# myportfolio

This site contains two html docs that are linked together as well as 
information about skills I can offer my future employer.
The first page includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to access 
apps that I have deployed. There are also links to my resume and my contact inforamtion, such
as Linkdin and github. This site is responsive to mobile users.
